Support is Easy
Calling it something else is hard

Many development shops have a support department. Typically support is an offering that revolves around a set or series of sets of tasks. It should minimially offer Drupal Core security updates, and likely contrib to some extent. So after that you just arbitrarily pick where and how you extend your offering.

Performing updates, checking the status report and various reporting services (I am a big fan of Droptor), taking tickets or bug reports are all pretty straightforward tasks that genrally have clear objectives and only require a standard amount of defining done. Most of the tasks should range from thirty minutes to about eight hours. It can also include routine 24/7 autoated monitoring and recovery as well as emergency response and expertise; if there is a hack and a bunch of recovery needs to happen it can jump from ten to twenty to fifty hours in a few days. 

So this idea that we sell that we agree to call 'support' is not just the easy stuff. It isn't just the small ticket items. It isn't just low-risk and low-priority. Support is only those things when things aren't going wrong. Presumably, you do the low-cost, low-risk, and low-priority stuff while it is still 'low' and that keeps it staying 'low'.
